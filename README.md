Command line tools help users run DDNS and introspective tunnels
in order to run this app, either download a release or use git to
clone this repository to your computer.

it will ask you if you wish to run in DDNS or TUNNEL modes
TUNNEL will make your selected endpoint available to public swarm
networking connections using hyperswarm, DDNS instead just answers
a simple text response, so that the swarm network can be leveraged
by nameservers to discover your IP

When you're asked to provide a seed to randomize your key, you can
type any text for it to use, it allows you to memorize your key
so you can generate it again down the line
